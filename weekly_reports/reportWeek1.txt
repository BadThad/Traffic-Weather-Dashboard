A kickoff meeting where we prelimarily divided up the tasks and discussed our
project structure as well as some details about naming conventions. We set up the project in
GitHub and added our first to-do's to the board in GitHub Projects, the utility we chose to use
to track the progress of the project.

A follow-up meeting where we agreed on the roles and tasks. We discussed roughly the goals 
for each week of the project, which largely fell in line with the goals set out by the 
group assigment.

Friday 2025-03-07
Weekly progress meeting to review how the project is progressing and what was accomplished during
the week. We also decided that we would have at least 2 meetings per week, one on Monday to lay out
the goals for the week, and one on Friday to review.
